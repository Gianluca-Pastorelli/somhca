Description: Implements self-organising maps combined with hierarchical cluster analysis (SOM-HCA) for clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data.
    The package includes functions to estimate the optimal map size based on various quality measures
    and subsequently generates a model with the selected dimensions.
    It also performs hierarchical clustering on the map nodes to group similar units.
